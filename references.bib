abstract = "This paper presents a review of — and classification scheme for — the literature on the application of data mining techniques for the detection of financial fraud. Although financial fraud detection (FFD) is an emerging topic of great importance, a comprehensive literature review of the subject has yet to be carried out. This paper thus represents the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature review of the data mining techniques that have been applied to FFD. 49 journal articles on the subject published between 1997 and 2008 was analyzed and classified into four categories of financial fraud (bank fraud, insurance fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other related financial fraud) and six classes of data mining techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The findings of this review clearly show that data mining techniques have been applied most extensively to the detection of insurance fraud, although corporate fraud and credit card fraud have also attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In contrast, we find a distinct lack of research on mortgage fraud, money laundering, and securities and commodities fraud. The main data mining techniques used for FFD are logistic models, neural networks, the Bayesian belief network, and decision trees, all of which provide primary solutions to the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent data. This paper also addresses the gaps between FFD and the needs of the industry to encourage additional research on neglected topics, and concludes with several suggestions for further FFD research."

The proposed data-customised approach combines elements of supervised and unsupervised methodologies aiming to compensate for the individual deficiencies of the methods. We demonstrate the ability of the hybrid model to identify fraudulent activity on the real debit card transaction data. We also explore the model’s efficiency against that of the existing monitoring system of the collaborating bank, using appropriate performance assessment criteria."

Anomaly detection is an important tool to detect abnormalities in many different domains including financial fraud detection, computer network intrusion, human behavioural analysis, gene expression analysis and many more. Recently, in the financial sector, there has been renewed interest in research on detection of fraudulent activities. There has been a lot of work in the area of clustering based unsupervised anomaly detection in the financial domain. This paper presents an in-depth survey of various clustering based anomaly detection technique and compares them from different perspectives. In addition, we discuss the lack of real world data and how synthetic data has been used to validate current detection techniques."
